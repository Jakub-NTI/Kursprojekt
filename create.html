        <h1>Who is your character?</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="indented">Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knig⁠ht or a grizzled so⁠ldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.
        <br> <br> Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?
        <br> <br> The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indented isbold">Proficiencies</p>
        <p class="indented"> Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills
            <br> <br> In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools
            <br> <br> If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indented isbold">Languages</p>
        <p class="indented">Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indented isbold">Equipment</p>
        <p class="indented">Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indented isbold">Suggested Characteristics</p>
        <p class="indented">A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own crea⁠tion.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indented isbold">Customizing a Background</p>
        <p class="indented">You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setti⁠ng. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipm⁠ent package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.</p>

        <h1>Race</h1>
        <p class="isbold">Racial Traits</p>
        <p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="isbold">Age</p>
        <p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="isbold">Alignment</p>
        <p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="isbold">Size</p>
        <p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="isbold">Speed</p>
        <p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="isbold">Languages</p>
        <p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="isbold">Subraces</p>
        <p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.</p>
